# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is related with the presence or no of heart disease. After pre-processing data, data visualization were used and barplots, scatterplots and correlation matrix were used. Some Classification Models such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network were used. Finally, barplot and ROC curve were created for clearest comparison between the models and more understandable results.
